Extraction of anonymous COVID-19 data in Bogota, Colombia, allows for filtering, and creation of statistics locally. 

It includes two distinct versions of the code to showcase progression in programming and data processing skills‚Äîfrom an early university version to an improved version using more advanced techniques. Versions: "v1-original" (2020 version), and "v2-upgrade" (2025 version).

Python 3.11.9 64-bit was used. Previous versions might work.
